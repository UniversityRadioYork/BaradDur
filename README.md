What if the scheduler wasn't INSIDE myradio? what then huh?
We also bring in some admin tools and allow for observations at a glance for if shows actually happened.

## Todo:
Not in priority order

- Reject application
- View clashes on custom time slot form update
- Make allocation call work on prod
- List of shows this term
- Add some links to the right pages of myradio for other bits that come up
- Make sure login permissions are checked correctly for deployment
- Change port for deployment
- Implement tailwind with tailwind CLI for deployment
